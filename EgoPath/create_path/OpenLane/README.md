# OpenLane Dataset Processing Script


## Overview

OpenLane is a large-scale benchmark for lane detection and topology estimation, widely used in autonomous driving and ADAS research. The dataset features diverse road scenarios, complex lane topologies, and high-resolution images. This script suite provides tools for parsing, preprocessing, and transforming OpenLane data for downstream tasks such as drivable path detection, BEV (Bird-Eyes-View) transformation, and model training.
