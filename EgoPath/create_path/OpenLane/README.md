# OpenLane Dataset Processing Script


## Overview

OpenLane is a large-scale benchmark for lane detection and topology estimation, widely used in autonomous driving and ADAS research. The dataset features diverse road scenarios, complex lane topologies, and high-resolution images. This script suite provides tools for parsing, preprocessing, and transforming OpenLane data for downstream tasks such as drivable path detection, BEV (Bird-Eyes-View) transformation, and model training.


## I. Preprocessing flow

### 1. Extra steps

OpenLane annotations provide lane lines as sequences of (u, v) coordinates, with each lane potentially containing a large number of points. To ensure consistency and efficiency, the following steps are performed:

- **Sampling:** : lanes with excessive points are downsampled to a manageable number using a configurable threshold.
- **Sorting:** : lane points are sorted by their y-coordinate (vertical axis) to maintain a consistent bottom-to-top order.
- **Deduplication:** : adjacent points with identical y-coordinates are filtered out to avoid redundancy.
- **Anchor calculation:** : each lane is assigned an anchor point at the bottom of the image, along with linear fit parameters for further processing.
- **Lane classification:** : lanes are classified as left ego, right ego, or other, based on their anchor positions and attributes.
- **Drivable path generation:** : the drivable path is computed as the midpoint between the left and right ego lanes.

### 2. Technical implementations

Most functions accept parameters for controlling the number of points per lane (`lane_point_threshold`) and verbosity for debugging. All coordinates are rounded to two decimal places for efficiency and are not normalized until just before saving to JSON.

During processing, each image and its associated lanes are handled with careful attention to coordinate consistency, especially when resizing or cropping is involved in downstream tasks.
