The [**UrbanSyn Dataset**](https://www.urbansyn.org/) is an open synthetic dataset featuring photorealistic driving scenes. It contains ground-truth annotations for semantic segmentation, scene depth, panoptic instance segmentation, and 2-D bounding boxes, providing more than 7.5k synthetic annotated images. It was born to address the synth-to-real domain gap, contributing to unprecedented synthetic-only baselines used by domain adaptation (DA) methods. After accounting for samples in the test set for which data was not available, there are **a total of 6,732 training samples with associated ground truth data.**
