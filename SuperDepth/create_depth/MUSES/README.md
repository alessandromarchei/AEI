[MUSES, the MUlti-SEnsor Semantic perception dataset](https://muses.vision.ee.ethz.ch/), designed for driving under increased uncertainty and adverse conditions. MUSES comprises a diverse collection of images, evenly distributed across different combinations of weather conditions (clear, fog, rain, and snow) and illuminations (day time/night time). The dataset contains camera images with a 3D LIDAR pointcloud from a MEMS LIDAR scanner (depth up to 200m). A depth-map can be calculated by projecting the 3D LIDAR points on to the camera image frame.
