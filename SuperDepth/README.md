## SuperDepth
Self-driving cars require an understanding of important edge case scenarios that can occur in driving scenes. SuperDepth is a neural network which addresses this challenge by processesing raw images and predicting the true per-pixel depth of all pixels in the input image, allowing for a complete 3D reconstruction of the driving scene. The outputs of SuperDepth can then be used to detect the **object-ness** of every pixel through methods such as 3D Voxel Analysis, to detect all static, movable, and moving objects in the scene, irrespective of what that object is. This type of classification-agnostic obstacle detection is an essential component in robustly dealing with 'long-tail' edge case scenarios. SuperDepth is part of the [AutoSeg Foundation Model](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.privately-owned-vehicles/tree/main/AutoSeg) which forms the core of the vision-pipeline of the [Autoware Autonomous Highway Pilot System](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.privately-owned-vehicles/tree/main)
